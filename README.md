## Tools and Plugins

* **Auto Route:** Itâ€™s a Flutter navigation package, it allows for strongly-typed arguments passing, effortless deep-linking and it uses code generation to simplify routes setup, with that being said it requires a minimal amount of code to generate everything needed for navigation inside of your App.  [Link](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route)

* **Auto_Size_Text:** Flutter widget that automatically resizes text to fit perfectly within its bounds.  [Link](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_size_text)

* **Bloc & Flutter_Bloc:** This design pattern helps to separate presentation from business logic. Following the BLoC pattern facilitates testability and reusability. This package abstracts reactive aspects of the pattern allowing developers to focus on writing the business logic.

* **Flutter_Hooks:** Hooks are a new kind of object that manage the life-cycle of a Widget. They exist for one reason: increase the code-sharing between widgets by removing duplicates.
